# Test Automation Example

This repository showcases a Python UI automation skeleton built with
Playwright, pytest, and the Page Object Model.

## Project layout

```
├── config/                 # Global settings (base URL, etc.)
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── tests/
    ├── conftest.py         # Shared fixtures
    ├── data/               # Test data samples
    ├── fixtures/           # Browser and Playwright fixtures
    ├── pages/              # Page Object Model abstractions
    └── test_home_page.py   # Example smoke test
```

## Getting started

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
pytest
```

## Next steps

- Expand configuration management if different environments are required.
- Integrate rich reporting (Allure, Playwright traces, CI test analytics).
- Expand the Page Objects and test coverage according to product requirements.
